BNB48IP-8: Proposal about new Koge Burning Procedure
Ian BNB48April 18, 2021
Considering the issue of Koge's liquidity size, a new liquidity-burning model is proposed here, specifically as follows:



Use the allocated BNB to build a single-asset liquidity pool, that is, a liquidity burning pool.

The BNB in this liquidity pool will never be withdrawn unless otherwise determined by all Koge holders through the governance process.

Koge passively bought by the liquidity pool will be regularly (manually at first ) withdrawn for destruction. For example, every quarter, the Koge from the previous quarter will be withdrawn for burning and new BNB from current quarter will be deposited.

Such a single-asset liquidity pool can be realized through Dodo, and through this way we can effectively avoid dramatic impact on the market price caused by buy-back and burn.

---------------------

考虑到Koge的交易深度问题，在此提议一种新的流动性销毁模式，具体为：

使用待用于回购的BNB构建单资产流动性池，即销毁流动池。
注入该流动性池的BNB除非经Koge全体持有者经治理流程另有决议，否则永不提取。
流动性池被动买入的Koge定期提取进行销毁。例如每季度提取出上季度至今的Koge予以销毁并注入本季度用于销毁的BNB。
这样的单资产流动池可以通过Dodo予以实现，以流动性池的方式销毁也可以避免销毁对市价带来的剧烈影响。
