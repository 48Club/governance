Proposal about 2021Q1 Koge Burning
According to the 2021Q1 financial report, as of 20201224, the equity attributable to all Koge holders is equivalent to 103,917 BNB, and non-current assets are equivalent to 77,122 BNB.

During the period, the self-delegation required for the BSC validator maintained by the Club was forced to be increased by 23,467 BNB. Based on this trend, an equivalent amount of 23,467 BNB was reserved for the next operation period.

According to the Koge light paper, the redundant profit for this period is 103917-77122-23467 = 1664 BNB, and 1664/2 = 882 BNB should be used to buy back Koge and destroy it.

It is proposed to proceed accordingly.

关于2021Q1销毁Koge的提案
根据2021Q1财报显示，截止20201224归属于全体Koge持有人的权益等值103,917 BNB，非流动资产等值77,122 BNB。

期间俱乐部维护的BSC验证节点所需自抵押上升了23, 467 BNB，据此趋势为下期运营预留等额即23, 467 BNB 必要运营资金。

按照Koge轻皮书的约定，本期冗余盈利为 103917-77122-23467 = 1664 BNB，应当使用 1664/2 = 882 BNB 回购Koge并进行销毁。

提议照此执行。
