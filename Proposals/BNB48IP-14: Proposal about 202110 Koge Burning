BNB48IP-14: Proposal about 202110 Koge Burning
Ian BNB48October 14, 2021
According to the 2021Q3 financial report, as of 20211012, the equity attributable to all Koge holders is equivalent to 122,374.84 BNB BNB, and non-current assets are equivalent to 118101.19 BNB.



According to the Koge light paper, reserving 273.65 BNB for operation and maintenance in next quarter, we have a redundant profit in this period of 4000 BNB, therefore hereby I propose we will allocate 2000 BNB into Koge repurchasing pool.



根据2021Q3财报显示，截止20211012归属于全体Koge持有人的权益等值122,374.84 BNB，非流动资产等值118101.19 BNB。

按照Koge轻皮书约定，预留273.65BNB供下季度运营开销后，录得本期冗余盈利4000 BNB，故此提议拨付2000 BNB进入Koge回购流动池。
