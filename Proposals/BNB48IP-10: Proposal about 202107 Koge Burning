BNB48IP-10: Proposal about 202107 Koge Burning
Ian BNB48July 12, 2021
According to the 202107 financial report, as of 20210705, the equity attributable to all Koge holders is equivalent to 118,906.58 BNB, and non-current assets are equivalent to 117,473.25 BNB.



According to the Koge light paper, reserving 433 BNB for operation and maintenance in next quarter, we have a redundant profit in this period of 1000 BNB, therefore hereby I propose we will allocate 500 BNB into Koge repurchasing pool.



根据2021Q2财报显示，截止20210705归属于全体Koge持有人的权益等值118,906.58 BNB，非流动资产等值117,473,25 BNB。

按照Koge轻皮书约定，预留433BNB供下季度运营开销后，录得本期冗余盈利1000 BNB，故此提议拨付500 BNB进入Koge回购流动池。
