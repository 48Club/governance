BNB48IP-9: Proposal about 2021Q2 Koge Burning
Ian BNB48April 18, 2021
According to the 2021Q2 financial report, as of 20210318, the equity attributable to all Koge holders is equivalent to 113,091 BNB, and non-current assets are equivalent to 120,291 BNB.



According to the Koge light paper, there is no redundant profit in this period.



But considering:



The Q2 financial report data collection period is when node competition is fierce when fixed assets account for a relatively high proportion. At present, 5 different candidate nodes have quite from the competition one after another, thus the degree of competition has greatly eased. It is expected that some BNB funds can be withdrawn as working capital.
The financial report collection day is also a period of time when the BSC node income is relatively high. At present, there are 4000 BNB in pledge account activity funds.
Therefore, it is recommended to still allocate a portion of BNB for Koge repurchase, and the recommended amount is 1000 BNB.



根据2021Q2财报显示，截止20210318归属于全体Koge持有人的权益等值113,091 BNB，非流动资产等值120,291 BNB。

按照Koge轻皮书约定，本期无冗余盈利。

但考虑到：

Q2财报数据采集期间是节点竞争较为激烈的时候，固定资产占比较高，目前已经陆续有5个不同候选节点先后退出竞争，竞争程度大为缓解，预计有部分BNB资金可以撤出为流动资金。
财报采集日至今也是BSC节点收入较高的一段时间，目前质押账户活动资金已经有4000 BNB。
因此建议仍然拨付一部分BNB进行Koge回购，建议金额为1000 BNB。
